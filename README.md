# This is my personal wiki
smautsm
This is a place for me to store my notes. I have made this public so I can share notes with others, and maybe they'll help out a stranger on the internet.

On here you'll find information on how to:
- Think
- Code
- Work
- Live

More specifically, the created site:

- Think - Metacognition, logic, mental models, neuroscience
- Code - Python, machine learning, cloud devops
- Work - leadership, communication, productivity
- Live - Philosophy, happiness

## Why are you posting this online?

I believe that the internet is the most influential development of modern civilization. It allows for mass collaboration across highly diverse populations, and creates immense wealth, knowledge, and innovation.

Part of what makes the internet amazing is that you can interact with strangers. These are people that might:
- be able to teach you something
- be able to learn something from you
- be willing to buy something from you

As such, I am posting things I learn share my ideas with the world, in the hopes to help someone struggling with the same challenges I am overcoming, and to get feedback, ideas, and insights from those that are just ahead of me in my pursuits.
