# The Effective Decision by Peter Drucker

In his popular article ["The Effective Decision,"](https://hbr.org/1967/01/the-effective-decision) Peter Drucker explains that effective executives do not make a great many decisions. Instead, they concentrate on what is important and try to make the few important decisions on the highest level of conceptual understanding.

Drucker outlines a sequence of steps involved in the decision-making process:

1. **Classifying the problem:** Is it generic? Is it exceptional and unique? Or is it the first manifestation of a new genus for which a rule has yet to be developed?
2. **Defining the problem:** What are we dealing with?
3. **Specifying the answer to the problem:** What are the “boundary conditions”?
4. **Deciding what is “right,” rather than what is acceptable,** in order to meet the boundary conditions: What will fully satisfy the specifications before attention is given to the compromises, adaptations, and concessions needed to make the decision acceptable?
5. **Building into the decision the action to carry it out:** What does the action commitment have to be? Who has to know about it?
6. **Testing the validity and effectiveness of the decision** against the actual course of events: How is the decision being carried out? Are the assumptions on which it is based appropriate or obsolete?

By following these steps, executives can make effective decisions that drive their organizations forward.
