# My Computer Setup

## Hardware
- Microsoft Surface Laptop 4
    - I like the Surface line and haven't had any issues with mine personally or professionally for the past 6 years

## Software
- Windows 11
    - My infrastructure is Linux 100%, but I use Windows at home and at work on my laptop. I like having the bells and whistles without playing around getting everything to work
- Visual Studio Code
    - My IDE of choice. I use it for everything from Python to Markdown to Azure 
    - I use the following extensions:
        - Python
    - Code Spell Checker
    - GitHub Copilot
    - Markdown Preview Enhanced
    - Remote SSH
    - Remote Explorer
- Microsoft PowerToys
- Windows Terminal
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- GitHub Desktop
- Microsoft Edge
    - It's basically Chrome. I like that it has vertical tabs and that it's built into Windows
